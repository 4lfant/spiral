## Spiral

#### Spiral is a social space centered around users, their personalities and interests. It is based on self-standing thematic columns which represent a certain topic or part of userâ€™s life.

We believe that today people need something more comprehensive where they can fully express their personalities (life, thoughts, interests, experiences). At the same time, this comprehensiveness must be able to personalize for each user preferences. This means you can always find your place no matter how and for what do you want to use social media.

Spiral is a social space around user showcases which represent our inner worlds. Showcase is a digital version of your personality (interests, lifestyle, thoughts, etc) in the form of thematic columns, called hubs. You can think of it as your personal magazine where you can share everything you want in thematic rubrics.
Users are able to create an unlimited amount of hubs that represent part of their lives (hobbies, interests, work, hobbies, etc.). Each hub can be customized depending on user needs and desires (from appearance to access privacy).
